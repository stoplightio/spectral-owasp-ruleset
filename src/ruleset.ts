     * - Device fingerprinting: denying service to unexpected client devices

     * - Non-human patterns: analyze the user flow to detect non-human patterns
     *   (e.g. the user accessed the "add to cart" and "complete purchase"
     *   functions in less than one second)
     * - Consider blocking IP addresses of Tor exit nodes and well-known proxies
